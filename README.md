# Bash
*Not to be confused with [Bash, the terminal language](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)!*

## About Bash
**Bash** is a [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) game where you fight other people in various maps, game modes, and team modes. Bash is currently in Alpha, meaning that there may be drastic changes to the gameplay and the game's purpose itself. The game itself cannot be played at the moment because however, the Roblox page can be viewed [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/5366020282/).

Bash, formerly known as *Bug Bash*, is in Alpha. In this stage of development, we are still fiddling around with the purpose of the game, and still building the core features. We are, however looking forward to moving onto Betas in the near future, where we will experiment around with features, and add new content. Then, we will seek to move out of the Beta and into the release (at which point, we will let non-beta users start playing the game).

## About This Repo
The purpose of this repo is mainly for bug reports and insights. We want to share what we are doing with the world, and this is the best way to do it. Please do note, you will not find any assets of the game itself in the repository.

## Reporting Bugs/Issue
You are expected to report bug and issue titles in this format: `[Issue] This is an issue`, or `[Bug] This is a bug`. The difference between an issue and a bug is that an issue is working as implemented, however should not be done so that way. And a bug is something not behaving as intended.
